# Learning From Books

Learning From Books, or LFB for brevity, is a repository of problems and exercises from books I am reading to learn programming fundamentals.

Here you will see the result of my learning path through books on:
- UNIX
- C
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- SQL

I'm not assuming there is no other topics that would may be considered foundational. For this reason I'm glad to listen your comments on the subject. 

Welcome to LFB!
