### Notes

- Texts are in the same language of the book's edition (Spanish, in this case).
- Excercises are compiled using `gcc` with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags.
- Exercises are not a copy of the code examples from the book. This is not the point.
- I suggest to buy yourself a copy of the book to complement this exercises with the invaluable explanations by the authors.
- It's a classic book on one of the most resilient programming languages so don't hesitate and buy a copy.
